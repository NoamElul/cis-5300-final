Due to the nature of our project, which involved analyzing the results of hundreds of experiments on various combinations of classifiers and datasets, we do not have a single output to include here. It would be infeasible to include the raw classifier output of all of our experiments here. Instead, we include the "output" of our experiemnts, that is their results, in the form of an Excel spreadsheet. This is more appropriate for out project.

To generate and evaluate classifier output, please see the notebook in the code section, which generates the gold labels (by preprocessing the input datasets) and the output (using whichever model and datasets one wishes to evaluate).
